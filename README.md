## âœ¨ why i built this

i wanted to create something fun, useful, and a little wild â€” a tool that feels more like a friend than a form.  
itâ€™s built entirely with **vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS**, plus a small **Node.js backend** to keep the OpenAI API key safe and rate-limited.

this was my first real full-stack project. no frameworks, no generators â€” just raw vibecoding âš¡

## ðŸ§± tech used

- frontend: html / css / js (no libraries)
- backend: node.js + express  
- openai api (via secure backend)
- rate limiting to prevent abuse

---

## ðŸ”’ api key protection

API requests are routed through a simple Express server (`server.js`) to keep the OpenAI key hidden.  
rate limiting is also in place to prevent spam and overuse.
